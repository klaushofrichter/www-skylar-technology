# Changelog

Versions are **generated at deploy time**, not carried in the sources: a merge
into `production` is tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD.N`, where `N` counts that day's
releases. Nothing needs bumping and nothing can be forgotten.

Each release's notes are assembled from the commits since the previous one,
preceded by anything curated under Unreleased below. The full history lives on
the [releases page](https://github.com/klaushofrichter/www-skylar-technology/releases);
this file is where notes are written *before* a release, not an archive of them.

<!-- Anything written under Unreleased is prepended to the next release's
     notes. Keep prose out of it unless you mean it to be published. -->
## [Unreleased]

- Automatic calendar-versioned releases on every deploy to `production`,
  with the version shown in the page footer and returned by `/health`.
- Base image upgraded to Node 24.
